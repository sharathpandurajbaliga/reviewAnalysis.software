en-test-0002	You can't go wrong!!!
en-test-0003	Just got back from three fantastic nights in Barcelona and wanted to give this hotel a review it really deserves.
en-test-0004	One of the cups supplied had a major crack in it and the bathroom floor was dangerously hot near the sink.
en-test-0005	I mean...your job is to accomodate guest's booking, not to bargain with them???
en-test-0006	Would stay there again.
en-test-0007	Lunch, they forgot one meal.
en-test-0008	My purchases, either don't show up on the email or the ones that show are a pure deception not to call it fraud, not renting a car ever and /or booking national express.
en-test-0009	to teach something to my freinds.
en-test-0010	Also offline is available only for hindi but not for Indian languages like Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Odia, etc.
en-test-0011	Receptions were a chaos with so many other guests complaining.
en-test-0012	Please get back original Skype look.
en-test-0013	Had dinner in the main restaurant and the service was slow again, Sofitel been a well known hotel chain had higher expectations.
en-test-0014	We have visited other hotels in Bali with 4 stars anf all of them had a much better quality.
en-test-0015	1. Download files from some file hosts properly, including rapidshare.com, mediafire.com, megaupload,com, 4shared.com and hotfile.com.

en-test-0019	The staff aren't helpful at all and some were even plain rude.
en-test-0020	Water pressure in shower was weak.
en-test-0021	very good and useful.
en-test-0022	It was stupid idea to break known to million people apperiance!
en-test-0023	Our experience for the three days we spent at the hotel was very positive.
en-test-0024	I didn't like the entrance way.
en-test-0025	I wanted to order multiple pitchers or cocktails for some of our guests but there were only a couple of jugs available.
en-test-0026	-Too many unresolved issues with Video download plugin!
en-test-0027	What happened to the SMS text function?
en-test-0028	That is a message that If EA used this graphic engine in Need for Speed Shift, they could have sold more PC copies of this game.
en-test-0029	They take aarp which always helps.
en-test-0030	good idea for future OS, when some feature not easy
en-test-0031	Now I can't log in at all, I reinstalled the app as well but same problems.
en-test-0032	Google Inc.
en-test-0033	When I'm working on my desktop machine, I'm generally working on a number of interleaved project, simultaneously.
en-test-0034	This editor is good, but could still use some Hot needed improvements!
en-test-0035	The breakfast food at the outdoor cafe was bland, mediocre at best.
en-test-0036	Location is brilliant, close to everything.
en-test-0037	There isnt much to do around other than Nikki Beach
en-test-0038	It simply does not work as it is meant to do.
en-test-0039	and i dislike those fancy showers where you never kniw how to get warm water or cold and if it goes to overhead shower or the other outlet.
en-test-0040	My husband and I came to Paris to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, and after reading lots of reviews, we decided to stay at Hotel Signature.
en-test-0041	The staff were very friendly and helpful and dining there was a good experience.
en-test-0042	The rooms here are beautifully appointed, with a very comfortable bed.
en-test-0043	i think its fun to play on
en-test-0044	Gabriel House was wonderful and the Staff was fantastic.
en-test-0045	I prefer the previous version!!!
en-test-0046	My first interaction was at the check in counter.
en-test-0047	Now i can view TGA files!
en-test-0048	Don't go by the pics they advertise, it's so much smaller than it seems to be.
en-test-0049	very good.
en-test-0050	Horrible airline company, don't you dare chose it!
en-test-0051	The hotel is in a great location as it is in the centre of the city.
en-test-0052	It works
en-test-0053	A beautiful view an excellent food.
en-test-0054	Doesn't Facebook own Instagram?
en-test-0055	So far it's the only player that make winME be able to play FLV file.
en-test-0056	Best vacation for my wife and I as we celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary.
en-test-0057	The welcome was great as our flight had been delayed a 1hr.
en-test-0058	Restaurant menus lacked variety and was very expensive for what it was.
en-test-0059	And it would be cool if chikatoria totodile and cyndaquil could be added too aswell as tepig snivy and oshawott and other starters if there are any.
en-test-0060	Like my second home.
en-test-0061	We loved the private spa.
en-test-0062	This is one of the most enjoyable hotels I've stayed in.
en-test-0063	I was a little disappointed in the gardens, considering their fame in horticultural circles.
en-test-0064	And is easy to use and suitable for all users
en-test-0065	There was no problem - housekeeper on the way I heard.
en-test-0066	Location and food was nice
en-test-0067	It does not feel like a tourist section of Paris.

en-test-0075	Perfectly placed for our long weekend, the hotel itself was ideal.

en-test-0077	NOT unless you speak French!
en-test-0078	Minor things - That you have to pay more to attend any activity such as yoga etc.
en-test-0079	I just loaded the latest version of

en-test-0082	at first the location was excellent.
en-test-0083	Pooll is sways clean and nice after a long day of meetings.
en-test-0084	maybe i was doing something wrong, i dont know, i will give it another go to see if i can get it to work.

en-test-0086	Restaurant 2 star Michelin : an experience not to be missed .
en-test-0087	Our room was very outdated and not at all like the picture and the bathroom could have done with a good clean.

en-test-0090	The room was clean and comfortable.

en-test-0092	Also, room was not clean enough so first visit the room, I wiped out some dust on the table and telephone.
en-test-0093	Quite a far walk to the beach and a lot of mosquitoes.
en-test-0094	From the minute you depart your taxi the experience begins.
en-test-0095	Very well located hotel in centre of city (district Chueca), nevertheless in relatively quiet area on Plaza Santa Barbara (see pictures).
en-test-0096	Or not.
en-test-0097	Its Always Been My Favorite Media Player.

en-test-0103	False sense of security and privacy are what Hotspot offering!!!
en-test-0104	The rooms are comfortable with great high ceilings.
en-test-0105	Cocktails and wine are the same price or more expensive as they would be at home.
en-test-0106	Easily accessible.
en-test-0107	Breakfast very poor for the price (good presented but same as where it cost much less)
en-test-0108	It may have affected my decision to book.
en-test-0109	very fast and realiable, i have been using for 10 years now, and i considered of the best product in the market today and in future, for the future generation.
en-test-0110	WHY THE HECCCKKK DID YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS A GOOD FRICKING IDEA TO GET RID OF THE FLIPPING LIKE BUTTON AAAAAAARRGGGGHBIBOBDYDIGLH I LIKE THE APP BUT REMOVING THE FRICKING LIKE BUTTON IS SO FREAKKKING INCONVENIENT AND UNHELPFUUULLLLL IT MAKES LIKING THINGS SLOWER AND MORE DIFFICULT, UNLESS YOU GUYS ADD BEING ABLE TO SAVE A PIN TO MORE THAN ONE BOARD AT A TIME REMOVING THE LIKE BUTTON IS JUST INCONVENIENT AND FRUUUSSTTRRATTTIINNGGGGGGG Im sorry im just frustrated, i dont see why you would remove it personally but if possible i would like it back, it made liking things a lot easier and simpler so if possible please add it back.
en-test-0111	Tucked in on a side street, this small accommodation is big on service.
en-test-0112	Nothing is included in your stay, everything I mean really everything comes at an hefty price.
en-test-0113	Why not just stick to blue?
en-test-0114	Please type another keyword.
en-test-0115	The hotel should buy the restaurant.
en-test-0116	Nothing that I can think of.
en-test-0117	Its too good than cute PDF writer.
en-test-0118	The spa services were a welcome respite from the hustle of the Paris ...
en-test-0119	Jack hammers during breakfast...
en-test-0120	Loved the rooftop terrace and room terrace.
en-test-0121	The attractive Italian restaurant did not seem to be able to cater for dietary requirements; I'm Coeliac and have other dietary needs.
en-test-0122	But I will send one, later.
en-test-0123	Housekeeping needs to improve ...
en-test-0124	There is no point having a non-smoking room if the cleaning staff are smoking in the office down the hall.
en-test-0125	Quiet cool with everything you need from an Honor bar to sauna.
en-test-0126	On arrival we received a complimentary upgrade to an executive room.
en-test-0127	Swinging door is badly made - damaged the roller of my bag
en-test-0128	I had a pram and the stairs were a little challenging.

en-test-0130	-wanted me to send info back
en-test-0131	Keep up the hard work on this game it just gets better and better.
en-test-0132	Best part is, you can print all reports with one click, you can export to excel, I needed it most.
en-test-0133	The beds were really good.
en-test-0134	well, I'm having a hard time converting my videos through online converters it's such a bother so I decided to download a converter and I'm so glad I've found this one..
en-test-0135	I recommend it if you intend on planning ahead.
en-test-0136	Loved the deco architecture and design.
en-test-0137	Used to be 5* until the last few weeks.
en-test-0138	But this was due to the fact that we kept it in the cell phone's case.
en-test-0139	Plus a nice walk over to the Louis Viutton Foundation Museum.
en-test-0140	The best bed ever, so comfy.
en-test-0141	My first impression of this hotel:
en-test-0142	My wife and I each had a suitcase and there was nowhere to put them in our double room.
en-test-0143	Transactions made on weekend are updated on Tuesday ~ Please improve.
en-test-0144	Beautiful room, bed, great shower.
en-test-0145	Stayed one night while we were in the area on a little family trip to the zoo and COSI.
en-test-0146	Easy to slide,easy to type.
en-test-0147	Excellent amenities.
en-test-0148	Our best hotel experience in all of Spain.
en-test-0149	You have to go up or down stairs just to get to a room.
en-test-0150	Takes too long to load destinations and then app crashes.
en-test-0151	I gave up.
en-test-0152	Breakfast layout is needlessly spread out.
en-test-0153	Customer service is not exsistant, sends a premade responce and then closes the case.
en-test-0154	Worst update ever.
en-test-0155	This was an amazing experience.
en-test-0156	I just got Free PRIZES !
en-test-0157	Tired room, stained towels and sheets, poor attention to detail in room cleaning (areas missed or not replenished).
en-test-0158	Not at all!
en-test-0159	But it has a major flaw -- the player does NOT automatically
en-test-0160	Single beds in double rooms.
en-test-0161	The staff were fantastic, the room was amazing, the breakfast was incredible, the location was ideal, and the parking topped it all off.
en-test-0162	It's very limited on the editing options.
en-test-0163	Rich plug in library.
en-test-0164	The elevator seems to work up but not down.
en-test-0165	There a couple of issues I've been facing.
en-test-0166	Charming room.
en-test-0167	Having your own lil avatar is awesome!
en-test-0168	Waiting for the revert design just what Facebook did.
en-test-0169	Much trash washing up.
en-test-0170	safe and effected
en-test-0171	I don't usually leave reviews, but I have no choice.
en-test-0172	Very poor noise insulation, can here everything in corridor.
en-test-0173	Who'd never stay or recommended to anyone else.
en-test-0174	The hotel is ideally located amongst high end shops, bars and restaurants with numerous tourist attractions within easy reach.
en-test-0175	Running a fanfiction contest for a MMORPG I
en-test-0176	Everything looks so radically different now that the app doesn't even look like Skype anymore.
en-test-0177	Some of the jewelry on Amazon you can tell comes from Wish!
en-test-0178	At least give us an option to have the previous version.
en-test-0179	easy to use and light.
en-test-0180	Also, it has a BILLION ADS.
en-test-0181	I "WISH" that all I ordered will be delivered.
en-test-0182	Skype just works.
en-test-0183	This was an amazing find in Barcelona!
en-test-0184	The staff made our experience, they were so helpful they couldn't do enough for us, which was so lovely especially as our little girl is only 15months and it can be stressful being away with a baby.
en-test-0185	This Program Has the Solution!
en-test-0186	Having stayed in other hotels of the same calibre in Bali I felt that the service at the pool area could be improved a little in terms of responsiveness of staff and having extra additions like a complimentary bottle of water, some refreshing facial mist or a cold towel on arrival.
en-test-0187	Would not recommend staying here.
en-test-0188	Room too hot which didn't help.
en-test-0189	Great breakfast options.
en-test-0190	It was an excellent experience.
en-test-0191	and food/breakfast very average in quality, even the Ala cart menu in the second fine dinning restaurant was just above average.
en-test-0192	The noise of the Nikki bar and next door Club Med at night can take away some of the relaxed feeling you would otherwise get staying at this hotel.
en-test-0193	Staff were very accommodating and friendly.
en-test-0194	Great staff and loved the modern decor.
en-test-0195	I dislike that some real words aren't given to the cookie jar.
en-test-0196	When we arrived in Paris- the airline had lost my luggage.
en-test-0197	This game is great to pass time with.
en-test-0198	Bathrooms could be better but it didn't bother me at all
en-test-0199	Ample number of people staffing the reception desk so check in was fast and easy.
en-test-0200	The room itself was large and well kept.
en-test-0201	Make a paid version so we don't have to deal with the ads.
en-test-0202	We were not disappointed.
en-test-0203	M$ way to destroy things.
en-test-0204	The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help.
en-test-0205	At all.
en-test-0206	Fix it center setup encountered an error
en-test-0207	Initially I booked this hotel for the location as it is conveniently placed for restaurants, places to see and transport.
en-test-0208	COMPARE TO GTA AND TOD ROCKS
en-test-0209	However I didn't use the spa or fitness centre so unable to comment on those.
en-test-0210	When we inquired later that day she told us we needed to leave the card in the electricity in order for water to work.
en-test-0211	Not til the of the booking you see the total amount with taxes and fees.
en-test-0212	Overall, the game isn't too bad.
en-test-0213	Website looked very good and the reality didn't disappoint.
en-test-0214	Easy to use
en-test-0215	Extra bed in room I didn't ask for
en-test-0216	Well, I click download and go no-where.
en-test-0217	The staff are very attentive and eager to assist.
en-test-0218	I like this very much, it saves me lot of money.
en-test-0219	A messaging and calling app.
en-test-0220	I would spread my buoyant cheeks for him.
en-test-0221	This is the best VPN service I've ever used, good pricing, fast servers and reliable.
en-test-0222	Although I feel like girls should have more options....
en-test-0223	Breakfast should be included in the room rate as this is quite an expensive place to stay.
en-test-0224	That's a good picture viewer!
en-test-0225	The people who run this app are great for refunds, they always answer in a timely manner.
en-test-0226	it is very interesting
en-test-0227	because my laptop is so slow
en-test-0228	Overpriced for what was on offer.
en-test-0229	tv programmes are very good
en-test-0230	Seminyak and Kuta are horrible
en-test-0231	I love the fact that there are soooo many great useful great selections.
en-test-0232	- ideal for screencasting
en-test-0233	Been using BT client for a long time.
en-test-0234	I've been at this hotel for three days at the end of January.
en-test-0235	I won't stay here next trip.
en-test-0236	The room quality was poor - old quite used up furniture, the bathroom had rust, the towels had some stains.
en-test-0237	Ordered coffee at breakfast and after 20 minutes still no coffee.
en-test-0238	c++_programming processor
en-test-0239	Scan took so long to finish.
en-test-0240	Loving this game!
en-test-0241	Poor cleanliness, Bathrooms had a big stone seat in the middle of the shower, I tried to move it out of the way, seeing all the accumulated rubbish/dirt underneath, I left it where it was, all floor, glass and bench tops had not been wiped properly...
en-test-0242	The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful in planning our daily itinerary and the accommodations were top rate.
en-test-0243	And CCC restaurant was quite expensive but small portion of food and taste was not impressive.
en-test-0244	The location is very conveniently close to the beach and to the old city.
en-test-0245	Did not feel like having a drink there.
en-test-0246	The family was extremely pleased about our stay.
en-test-0247	its best for non touch device.
en-test-0248	I had to come back and update this review because omg.
en-test-0249	A lovely located away from the busy city life.
en-test-0250	I liked the restaurant on the rooftop.
en-test-0251	2. AWSOME DESIGN OF CARS
en-test-0252	How do I see if my contacts are available on Skype?
en-test-0253	I was highly impressed by the room, service and amenities.
en-test-0254	This app is very hit or miss.
en-test-0255	Needs more hairstyles!
en-test-0256	OPINION OF DEVJIT:
en-test-0257	I will definitely stay there again!
en-test-0258	I'm eventually going to have to move our group chat to what's app I'm thinking.
en-test-0259	it's easy to
en-test-0260	Perfect, I´m missing possibility how to collect more object then only one.
en-test-0261	Browsing was a nightmare.
en-test-0262	I have never felt shrek deprived ever since that day.
en-test-0263	The room was clean, tidy, comfy bed, quiet, good selection of choices for breakfast, friendly staff.
en-test-0264	Monitored by Google
en-test-0265	Front desk a little special, however this is Mexico City.
en-test-0266	Great room at a reasonable rate.
en-test-0267	Nothing much, maybe just the room arrangement
en-test-0268	You can hear noise from street, english language level could be better for receptionist.
en-test-0269	The property is situated on a hill , prepare to climb (it's about 10 to 15 min on foot from the city centre)
en-test-0270	enough said.
en-test-0271	Quick and easy download and uploading !
en-test-0272	The most stupid replica of the real app.
en-test-0273	I stayed here for 2 nights pre-cruise after coming from another hotel in the Eixample area where I stayed for 5 nights.
en-test-0274	bullshit!
en-test-0275	A really great boutique hotel in a terrific part of Paris.
en-test-0276	We booked in here for two nights, and decided on this location as it was near many interesting places accessible by foot.
en-test-0277	I understand that that is a way you finance the app or whatnot, but it is not acceptable to have an ad every few pictures.
en-test-0278	New layout is terrible, why break something that was fine?
en-test-0279	Waste of my bloody licence money.
en-test-0280	We happened upon Hotel Da Vinci and fell in love with the boutique hotel, location, and Gisepie- so we booked onsite for the very next night and totally loved it!.
en-test-0281	Its a good for video calls and easily connected to every one and in our country it
en-test-0282	Went to Columbus Zoo with my daughter.
en-test-0283	It was like a little oasis of calm.
en-test-0284	The shower only dispensed scolding hot water making a cold shower to cool off impossible.
en-test-0285	me 32
en-test-0286	The only draw back was that we didn't get the sun all day at the villa, but this was actually a plus as it forced us to get out and explore!
en-test-0287	It was such great customer service and we appreciated it so much.
en-test-0288	I guess it's the little things that make your stay extra memorable.
en-test-0289	@kristensnyder
en-test-0290	Terribly designed program, with zero support.
en-test-0291	The easiest video downloader i have used.
en-test-0292	If you try to fast forward or rewind to a particular segment, the picture freezes while the audio plays.
en-test-0293	The update only allows me to see old ones.
en-test-0294	It was my sister's firs time in Paris, so I wanted to make it special, sister weekend.
en-test-0295	I think this app is a very good at helping you with so ya so I love it
en-test-0296	Value was terrific as were the staff and location.
en-test-0297	Room was very average with the 'city view' room facing roadworks that woke us up in the morning.
en-test-0298	Nice app.
en-test-0299	Food were ok except the porriage, fried rice were served cold.
en-test-0300	Absolutely awful new system implemented for the allocation of seats, purposely scattering groups across the plane trying to force us into paying for seats together.
en-test-0301	Driver Easy is an excellent software to optimize the drivers on PC and laptop.
en-test-0302	There are some adds but not overbearing.
en-test-0303	to plan my schedule,
en-test-0304	Works straight out of the box
en-test-0305	The drinks at 5:30 are a limit of 3/day and they give you a punch ticket to keep track.
en-test-0306	They say give them 27 days to deliver.
en-test-0307	To be strongly recommended!
en-test-0308	Just spent 4 nights at Malte with my wife of 51 years.
en-test-0309	Work with any type of PDF
en-test-0310	One bar and the way to the beach are under construction.
en-test-0311	For the price paid the service and facilities were impeccable - No negative comments at all!
en-test-0312	It was super easy to use.
en-test-0313	I dunno if they're device specific, but gotta have a solution.
en-test-0314	i like this software. softonic
en-test-0315	Perfect for a city break in Barcelona.
en-test-0316	Easy to use and very elegant.
en-test-0317	Ok so after playing for a week here are my thoughts.
en-test-0318	So I guess I will stick to Amazon where the prices are just as good, if not better and I get my stuff in a day or two and don't have to pay shipping at all, and they don't blow my phone up with notifications all the time.
en-test-0319	It was a perfect stay!
en-test-0320	That was an important point to tell us on arrival.
en-test-0321	thank you.
en-test-0322	Right now I'm only using it for picture in picture and the ability to draw on-screen.
en-test-0323	We have stayed at the Peninsula Tokyo which was an exceptional hotel experience so we immediately selected the Peninsula Paris for our 8 night stay.
en-test-0324	Had to pay for parking in the hotels parking facility.
en-test-0325	Out standing !
en-test-0326	Please revert.
en-test-0327	This makes it not free.
en-test-0328	Totally customer centric.
en-test-0329	how to transfer the contents from desktop to mobile please guide me!!!!
en-test-0330	so great.
en-test-0331	This particular one, was flat out falling down.
en-test-0332	A nice touch was the free snacks, and non alcoholic drinks that were available every afternoon and through the night.
en-test-0333	I want the nice patterns too lol
en-test-0334	I booked a room 4 months prior to my arrival, in the end my whole group was split up and I ultimately had to pay more in the end.
en-test-0335	The common areas on first floor are fine, as was the light breakfast offerings.
en-test-0336	Someone should be fired for allowing this parasitic behavior.

en-test-0345	The staff here is amazing and if that is a very important thing to you--you'll love it.
en-test-0346	We had deluxe rooms but were upgraded to a junior suite (good start!) - the hotel is boutique style with quirky decor & the rooms were great.

en-test-0350	The Spa provided one of the best facials I have received.
en-test-0351	Only one bath towel was provided but this could have been accidental.
en-test-0352	Staff suggested kebab, puzza or McDonalds.
en-test-0353	If I had to find something Id say the food and drinks were a bit pricey but it is a luxury hotel so to be expected.
en-test-0354	You can stay for far cheaper with similar amenities right next door, there's a whole row of resorts on this beach.

en-test-0367	Why should I be bothered by hindi when hindis aren't bothered with suggestions of Marathi.
en-test-0368	The design of the hotel is such that the rooms are on 5 floors above and surrounding the open air restaurant and bar on the first floor.

en-test-0380	it needs much tweeking.
en-test-0381	Everything is very modern and trendy, including the set up of the room with the shower and the bed speared by a glass wall.
en-test-0382	We stayed three nights in the cheapest room and it did not crimp on space or function.
en-test-0383	The staff is super friendly.
en-test-0384	-Be careful about the noise if your room is in the street side of the hotel.
en-test-0385	We were a family of three with one placed at the very front,one in the middle and one at the very back.
en-test-0386	This is worst possible version...
en-test-0387	i don't know how i would say something

en-test-0393	Every channel change, the same thing.
en-test-0394	Conveniently located near the waterfront, roughly equidistant from La Rambla, the Museu Picasso & Barceloneta, this boutique hotel (formerly a studio for Picasso) is a wonderful base for exploring BCN.

en-test-0396	Did not like the smell when I entered, but did not last for long.

en-test-0409	it's good
en-test-0410	My only slightly negative comment would be that maybe the management could maybe look at upgrading with some aircon , we had a fan which was supplied in the room , but it`s not the same and keeping the window open when facing the street at night was to noisy

en-test-0442	So after waiting 30 minutes at lobby, they found a king size bedroom, which had a faulty fridge and room was pretty warm.
en-test-0443	Although there are quite a few ads which get very annoying.
en-test-0444	The more we travel the more points etc and can be redeemed in future for other bookings or discounts.
en-test-0445	it is good in play and interesting
en-test-0446	My instincts led me to this hotel and it exceeded all my expectations.
en-test-0447	The location is perfect for those looking to explore the city.
en-test-0448	Limited options and same menu on the pool, in the restaurant and the room.
en-test-0449	Skype has an inefficient brand new layout that only works for some individuals.
en-test-0450	i hope it will work correctly .

en-test-0461	Third grade software with all features of trial version failing to satisfy any sensible use/needs.
en-test-0462	Because you have no competition.
en-test-0463	You have no control over the battle or the training, of your stat is higher then you win, if it's lower you lose.

en-test-0472	Downloaded this morning so I have the up to date version and I'm unable to log in, retrieve flights etc so I have an app that infact does nothing.

en-test-0474	We just got back from 10 days in Barcelona where we stayed at the Grand Hotel Central, which was a great base for our holiday.
en-test-0475	Plenty of plug in locations for various electronic devices.
en-test-0476	It is very easy to use and very lightweight and intuitive.
en-test-0477	And it works even with my super computer, Gateway Pentium 350.
en-test-0478	Instead of specializing in what it does well, skype seems to prefer to cater to everyone through "new" lukewarm features which thousands of other apps already have - and do it better -, simply cutting off many of the features considered essential by its long-time users, such as invisible statuses and deleting conversations, leading skype dangerously close to the pit of third-rate apps which don't really do much.
en-test-0479	- In our room (745) the floor was very smelly
en-test-0480	It fights with you every step of the way if you don't do EVERYTHING it's way.

en-test-0490	We didn't eat there again and thankful it was only 1 night.
en-test-0491	I have not bought from this app.
en-test-0492	I usually stay at one of the big US-based hotel chains when in Paris.
en-test-0493	Nice camera with many good edits.
en-test-0494	Please add a feature which stops videos from automatically playing even on wifi.
en-test-0495	The elevator actually came up along the wall next to my bed and I never heard it.
en-test-0496	it's very useful to restore data from RAW SD card.
en-test-0497	Can't wait to come back.
en-test-0498	The price of massage and we didn't find any bottle opener in our room while the water was in glass bottles with crown caps.
